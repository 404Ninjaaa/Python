# List and Dictionary Comprehension
# List Comprehension
'''
List comprehension is a short and clean way to create a list in Python using a single line of code instead of a loop.

Basic Syntax 🧠
new_list = [expression for item in iterable]

Example
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squares = [n*n for n in numbers]

print(squares)

Output:

[1, 4, 9, 16]


👉 This replaces:

squares = []
for n in numbers:
    squares.append(n*n)

With a Condition (Filtering) 🔍
evens = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]


Output:

[2, 4]

If–Else Inside List Comprehension
labels = ["even" if n % 2 == 0 else "odd" for n in numbers]


Output:

['odd', 'even', 'odd', 'even']


⚠️ Note: if-else comes before for.

In For loop

numbers = [1,2,3,4]
new_list = []
for i in numbers:
    add_number = i + 1
    new_list.append(add_number)
print(new_list)


List comprehension

new_list = [new_item for item in list]
new_list = [expression for item in iterable]

#example 0x1
numbers = [1,2,3,4]
new_list = [n+1 for n in numbers]
print(new_list)

# example 0x2
new_range = [n*2 for n in range(1,4)]
print(new_range)



with conditional list comprehension
new_list = [new_item for item in list if test]

#example 0x3
names = ["Alex", "Beth", "Caroline", "Dave" ,"Eleanor", "Freddie"]
s_names = [name for name in names if len(name) < 5]
print(s_names)
['Alex', 'Beth', 'Dave']
l_names = [name.upper() for name in names if len(name) < 5]
print(l_names)
['ALEX', 'BETH', 'DAVE']
