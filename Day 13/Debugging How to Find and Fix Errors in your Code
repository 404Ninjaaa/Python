Debugging

Tips and techniques to identify bugs
1. Describe the problem - know what is going on and logic behind it, asking what is this, why am I doing this,
2. Reproduce the bug - try to find out when bug occurs, and which part, change different values and observe errors
3. Play computer - act like a computer mimic it, see in the style of computer see the code step by step, first this one then it goes here, then here and ohh why am I doing this here it is a bug
4. Fixing the errors
5. Use print to debug and find bug 
For example
pages = 0
word_per_pages = 0
pages = int(input("Number of pages: "))
word_per_pages == int(input("Number of words per pages: "))
total_words = pages * word_per_pages
print(f"pages = {pages}")
print(f"word_per_pages = {word_per_pages}")
print(total_words)

Output
Number of pages: 34
Number of words per pages: 564
pages = 34
word_per_pages = 0
0
