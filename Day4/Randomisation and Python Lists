Randomization and python list


Pythons uses Mersenne Twister for randomness

askpython.com

import random
random_int = random.randint(1,223)
print(random_int)

How to create your own module (it is easy)\
Just create new python file on which you can to collaborate with other developers
And in your code just do “import their_pythonfile_name”





If we can to do with float number then we can use random.random but it gives us random float number only between 0 to 1
random_float = random.random()
print(random_float)

0.4049942374716222

But what if we need more value not just only 0 - 1 then we can multiple it with integer

import random
random_int = random.randint(1,100)
random_float = random.random()
print(random_float*random_int)

14.180569955073178





Seed
Python uses computer clock time as a seed by default but we can change it
import random
random.seed(16)
print(random.randint(1,100))

Now this code gonna give me same random number for entire time, always 47





Lists
Fruits = [item1, item2]
