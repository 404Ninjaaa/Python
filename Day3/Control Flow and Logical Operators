It is good thing to make flow chart before code

Multiple if
If condition1:
	do A
If condition2:
	do B
If condition3:
	do C


print("Welcome to the rollercoaster")
height = int(input("Input is your height in cm: "))
bill = 0

if height >=120:
    print("You can ride rollercoaster")
    age = int(input("Input your age: "))
    if age < 12:
        bill = 5
        print("Child tickets are $5")
    elif age <= 18:
        bill = 7
        print("Youth tickers are $7")
    else:
        bill = 12
        print("Adult tickets are $12")
    
    want_photo = input("Do you want a photo taken ? Y for yes and N for no ")
    if want_photo == "Y" or "y":
        bill += 3
    elif want_photo == "N" or "n":
        pass
    
    print(f"Your total bill is {bill}")

else:
    print("Sorry, you have little babe, get out")
