'''Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user’s weight and height.
It should tell them the interpretation of their MBI based on the BMI value.
Under 18.5 they are underweight
Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
Over 25 but below 30 they are overweight
Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
Above 35 they are clinically obese'''

Solution

h = float(input("Please enter your height:"))
w = float(input("Please enter your weight: "))
age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
bmi = w/h**2

if bmi > 18.5 and age > 30:
    print("Your are underweight please eat 🥺")
elif bmi == 18.5 and age < 25:
