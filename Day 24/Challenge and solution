Local File System and directories

# Read and write
file = open(“my_file.txt”) # ==> file has been opened
#Now how to read
contents = file.read()
print(contents)
file.close() # ==> it is necessary to close file because it will take resources just like closing tabs after use


It is a better idea to use “with” and “as” instead of just closing file manually



with open("my_file.txt") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

Same for writting but with some modes, by default it is in read mode ‘r’
Some modes
‘w’ ==> write it will remove previous data too
‘a’ ==> it will append data


with open("my_new_file.txt",mode='w') as file:
    file.write("\nThis is a new file")

It will create new file, if you don’t have one


Absolute vs Relative path



//Challenge mail merging

Readlines ==> returns all lines in a file, as a list where each line is an item in the list object


PLACEHOLDER ="[name]"

with open("invited_name.txt") as names_file:
    names = names_file.readlines()

with open("./Letters/starting_letter.docx") as names_file:
    letter_content = names_file.read()
    for name in names:
        stripped_name = name.strip()
        new_letter = letter_content.replace(PLACEHOLDER, stripped_name)
        with open(f"./Letters/letter_for{stripped_name}.docx", mode='w') as completed_letter:
            completed_letter.write(new_letter)
