Hey Ninjaaa here! I forgot to upload Day 1, thatâ€™s why I am doing this now. It is not just an ordinary 100 Days of Python challenge â€” it is a journey. Letâ€™s go with me! 
There will be more challenges than theory. I will upload what I learn from the prettiest and very talented teacher in this world, Dr. AngelaðŸ¥¹.
I have uploaded this in such a manner that you will learn basic but important things â€” not all the basics. You have to Google them by yourselvesðŸ¤­.
There are three ê ² sections I will upload in this GitHub repo:â€¨
The theory part (it will be the needed things you need ðŸ˜­ uff grammar ==> others you have to search for yourself),â€¨
The questions part, where I will upload the questions (questions will be uploaded whenever I want to upload i mean the extra questions)â€¨
And the solutions part â€” if you get stuck in any part, you can see the solutions.
You can use different methods as you wish because I am not there with you to check your assignment ðŸ¤“ just kidding. 
I know you are serious. You can do this, and yeah, you will â€” one day. Best of luck for your awesome journey, and it is for me too ðŸ¥º.

Donâ€™t use any AI unless it is important. I want you to learn it by yourself.

Letâ€™s gooooooooooooo!!!!
