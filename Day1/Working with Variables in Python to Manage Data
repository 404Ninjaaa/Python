Hey Ninjaaa here! I forgot to upload Day 1, that’s why I am doing this now. It is not just an ordinary 100 Days of Python challenge — it is a journey. Let’s go with me! 
There will be more challenges than theory. I will upload what I learn from the prettiest and very talented teacher in this world, Dr. Angela🥹.
I have uploaded this in such a manner that you will learn basic but important things — not all the basics. You have to Google them by yourselves🤭.
There are three ꠲ sections I will upload in this GitHub repo: 
The theory part (it will be the needed things you need 😭 uff grammar ==> others you have to search for yourself), 
The questions part, where I will upload the questions (questions will be uploaded whenever I want to upload i mean the extra questions) 
And the solutions part — if you get stuck in any part, you can see the solutions.
You can use different methods as you wish because I am not there with you to check your assignment 🤓 just kidding. 
I know you are serious. You can do this, and yeah, you will — one day. Best of luck for your awesome journey, and it is for me too 🥺.

Don’t use any AI unless it is important. I want you to learn it by yourself.

Let’s gooooooooooooo!!!!

You can also practice from this awesome github

print(“Hello World”)
Strings = ""
Errors
1. Syntax Error – Code structure is incorrect (e.g., missing : or brackets).
2. Runtime Error – Error occurs while the program is running (e.g., division by zero).
3. Logical Error – Code runs but gives wrong output due to flawed logic.
4. Semantic Error – Code is syntactically correct but does the wrong thing.
5. Compilation Error – Error during code compilation (e.g., type mismatch, missing semicolon).
6. Type Error – Operation used on the wrong data type (e.g., string + int).
7. Name Error – Variable or function is used without being defined.
8. Index/Key Error – Accessing a non-existent index in a list or key in a dictionary.


If you got problem then search on google, it is not a good practice to memorize everything, it is not even possible

‘’ Vs “”

print("Hello World!\n hello world")
Hello World!
 hello world

String concatenation

print("Apple"+" Ball")
print("Apple" + " " + "Ball”)

Apple Ball

Take input
a = input("What is your name? ")
print(a)
print(type(a))

What is your name? s
s
<class 'str'>


Type conversion
a = input("What is your number? ")
print(a)
a = int(a)
print(type(a))

What is your number? 1
1
<class 'int'>

In Python, variables are names used to store data.
Like name = salman
name is variable here

Based on Data Type:
1. int – Integer (e.g., x = 10)
2. float – Floating-point number (e.g., pi = 3.14)
3. str – String (e.g., name = "Alice")
4. bool – Boolean (e.g., flag = True)
5. list – Ordered, mutable sequence (e.g., nums = [1, 2, 3])
6. tuple – Ordered, immutable sequence (e.g., t = (1, 2))
7. set – Unordered, unique values (e.g., s = {1, 2, 3})
8. dict – Key-value pairs (e.g., d = {"a": 1})

Based on Scope:
1. Global variable – Defined outside functions, accessible anywhere.
2. Local variable – Defined inside a function, accessible only there.
3. Nonlocal variable – Used in nested functions to refer to outer scope.

Special Types:
1. Constant – Not a real type, but by convention written in all caps (e.g., PI = 3.14)
2. Class variable – Shared by all instances of a class.
3. Instance variable – Unique to each instance of a class.


🔹 Rules (must follow)
1. ✅ Can start with a letter (A–Z or a–z) or an underscore _ – Example: name, _temp
2. ❌ Cannot start with a number – Invalid: 1name ❌
3. ✅ Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores – Example: user_123, value2
4. ❌ No spaces or special characters like @, #, !, -, etc. – Invalid: user-name ❌
5. ❌ Cannot be a Python keyword (e.g., class, if, for, etc.) – Invalid: def = 10 ❌

🔸 Conventions (best practices)
1. 🐍 snake_case for regular variables – Example: user_name, total_price
2. 🔠 UPPER_CASE for constants (by convention) – Example: PI = 3.14, MAX_SPEED = 100
3. 👩‍🏫 Descriptive names are better than short/unclear ones – ✅ user_age > ❌ ua
4. 🔂 Use _ to separate words (not camelCase) – ✅ file_name > ❌ fileName (though camelCase is not wrong)
5. ⚠️ Avoid single-letter names unless used in loops or math – ✅ for i in range(10): is fine – ❌ x = 1 (unless it's a quick calculation)
