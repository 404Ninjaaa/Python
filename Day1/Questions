// Write a program in main.py that prints the same notes from the previous lesson using what you have learnt about the Python print function.
After you have written your code, you should run your program and it should print the following:
Day 1 - Python Print Function
The function is declared like this:
print('what to print')



//Debug this
#Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡

print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
  print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")



// Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.



// Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.
